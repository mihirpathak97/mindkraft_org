# MindKraft Boilerplate

A ready-to-run boilerplate for the MindKraft website.

Includes REST API calls and definitions. All you need to do is work on the frontend :grin: . The boilerplate comes built in with ReactJS + Material UI so frontend prototyping is a breeze.

## Note

This project was written by me when I did not fully understrand the workings of the web development world. Looking back at this code I sometimes have a good laugh :laughing:.

## Install

First clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mihirpathak97/mindkraft-boilerplate folder-name
```

And then install PHP and Node dependencies:

```bash
$ cd folder-name
$ yarn install
$ composer install
```

Read [Setup](https://github.com/mihirpathak97/mindkraft-boilerplate/wiki/Development) for further instructions.
